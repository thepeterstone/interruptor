# Interruptor

A silly bot to set channel topics in Slack.

## Usage

After installing the bot, invite it to a channel:
```
/invite @interruptor
```

Mention it with a list of usernames to set the
interrupt topic:
```
@interruptor /set @thepeterstone
```

To set the topic for multiple channels, give it a list of channels:
```
@interruptor /channels #general #random
```
